        </div>
        <div class="side-para">
          <p>OnCourse CRM needed help with user adoption and engagement on its platform. The existing interface could have been more apparent and manageable, with too many features and options that made it difficult for users to navigate and use the system effectively. The mobile application also needed more features and functionality than the web platform, leading to a disjointed user experience.</p>

                <li><p><b><u>Improve Consistency:</u> </b>We ensured that the web and mobile platforms provided a consistent experience using a similar design language and layout across all platforms.</p></li>
                <li><p><b><u>Add Customization Options:</u> </b>We added more customization options to allow users to tailor the system to their needs.</p></li>

                <li><p><b><u>Add New Features:</u>  </b>We added new features to the mobile application to match the functionality of the web platform, including the ability to create and edit records, view reports, direct Phone - SMS and access contact information.</p></li>

            <div class="side-para">
              <p>We organized a usability test to verify the effectiveness of our design solutions and identify any potential issues. This test involved sales representatives and managers whose feedback guided us in implementing several design modifications. Firstly, we streamlined the interface by eliminating extra options and features. Secondly, we improved the design's consistency even further across all platforms. Thirdly, we incorporated more customization options based on user feedback. Lastly, we refined the visual design to make it more legible and understandable. Our main goal with these modifications was to make our design more user-friendly and to satisfy the requirements of our intended audience.</p>
